#Dress For Success MN client app for Prime Group Project

##General Description
This scheduling application was designed for Dress for Success Twin Cities(DFSTC) by my team at Prime Digital Academy using MongoDB, Angular, Express, and Node. Our application provides database management tools to an DFSTC administrator, where they can schedule client meetings, view client data, and input new client information themselves. Additionally, we created a user view, where clients could digitally submit their information to DFSTC.

###Problem
DFSTCâ€™ previous client intake and scheduling process required a significant amount of paperwork that was given to the client via a caseworker and then filled out and returned to DFSTC by the caseworker. The information received from the client must then be manually entered into the system by a DFSTC employee. Often the information received is incomplete or illegible. 

During the paperwork process, the client is also responsible for selecting an appointment time from those provided by DFSTC. Unfortunately, this means that appointment slots are often taken before the client is able to select a time, requiring DFSTC staff to contact the caseworker or client to select a new time.

###General Solution
Dress for Success requires a system that eliminates the paperwork and hassle of the current scheduling system and ensures more complete information from the client. DFSTC also wants to reduce the number of phone calls its small staff needs to place to clients and partner agencies, so they can focus more attention on their clients and running the organization.
