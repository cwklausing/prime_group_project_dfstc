#Dress For Success MN client app for Prime Group Project

##General Description
###Problem
DFSTC’ previous client intake and scheduling process required a significant amount of paperwork that was given to the client via a caseworker and then filled out and returned to DFSTC by the caseworker. The information received from the client must then be manually entered into the system by a DFSTC employee. Often the information received is incomplete or illegible. During the paperwork process, the client is also responsible for selecting an appointment time from those provided by DFSTC. Unfortunately, this means that appointment slots are often taken before the client is able to select a time, requiring DFSTC staff to contact the caseworker or client to select a new time.
General Solution
Dress for Success requires a system that eliminates the paperwork and hassle of the current scheduling system and ensures more complete information from the client. DFSTC also wants to reduce the number of phone calls its small staff needs to place to clients and partner agencies, so they can focus more attention on their clients and running the organization.
The application should allow the client or caseworker to input contact and clothing size information. Automation of the scheduling process is also important. Clients need to be able to select timeslots from an up­to­date list. It is important that the application be mobile responsive for clients who are filling out the forms themselves. There should be an automated notification process for clients.
